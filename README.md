# Image Classification Model

This repository contains a simple image classification model built using TensorFlow/Keras. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Structure

- `data/` contains the CIFAR-10 dataset and preprocessing script.
- `models/` contains the model definition and utilities for training and saving the model.
- `notebooks/` includes Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
- `requirements.txt` lists all required Python libraries.
- `main.py` is the script used to train and evaluate the model.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/lucyz1125/Image-Classification-Model.git
2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the training script:
python main.py
4. After training, you can evaluate the model using the saved model file.
